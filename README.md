# merriam-webster-word-of-the-day
Want to learn new words everyday but don't want to search a website for it?
Just automate it.

For this project, I did some used web scraping using BeautifulSoup.
Then, I have created a GUI using Tkinter and the words that are scraped everyday are stored in a .txt file in case you want to backtrack.
